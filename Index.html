          <p>I have never been popular, that is until my first viral project. All of the sudden I was flooded with people asking for a cut from my revenue. I always said yes, because my income from that project was zero, and viral meant 10 coherent
            users, one of witch was my shittly configured raspberry pi home brew server. I learned from that though, and now I’m a millionaire, at least, one in the making. Truth be told I dunno where I am going next, life moves fast, and I have so
            muchthings to do. guess that’s why I always fail that job interview question. I hope it involves MIT and a life time of RVing.</p>
          <p>Currently though, I have a love for skiing and my dog, and coding, yes, I made this site from scratch and that shitty raspberry pie server :3. I have <a class="bglinkani  " href="https://workflowy.com/s/series/1FZjZDRaeFRT0dO3">a few things that I want to do next.</a></p>
